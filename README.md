![image](https://github.com/Arvindahb/oibsip_task3/assets/133552080/6480a4de-5a12-4e01-84d0-c0e6cf25d0a8)

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. This project files contains dataset, source code both ipynb and py and models of the machine learning files.
